Profiling library
=================

This library can be used to profile datasets standalone. You can use it to profile datasets on your side and send that to Datamart for search, instead of uploading the whole dataset. It is also used internally by Datamart to process search-by-example queries (when sending a file to the ``/search`` endpoint) and to add datasets to the index (to be queried against later).

Installing datamart-profiler
----------------------------

You can get it directly from the Python Package Index using PIP::

    pip install datamart-profiler
