Materialization library
=======================

This library can materialize datasets from Datamart. You can use it to materialize search results directly on your side without relying on the server. It is also used internally by Datamart to materialize datasets (the ``/download`` endpoint downloads the dataset using this library then sends it to you).

Installing datamart-materialize
-------------------------------

You can get it directly from the Python Package Index using PIP::

    pip install datamart-materialize
